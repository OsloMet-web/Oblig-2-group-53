            <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
            <p>Nowadays, soccer is more dynamic and athletic than ever. The game has become faster, stronger and more demanding in most aspects of physicality. While Messi might have more talent, Ronaldo’s combination of physical and technical abilities just makes him better. He is 6’’1 of pure Portuguese muscle. This means he’s very hard to push off the ball. Ronaldo’s combination of dizzying pace, great dribbling and powerful shooting with either foot terrorizes defenses.



                He is simply a better fit for today’s game. His athleticism is second to none; he combines dizzying pace with powerful shooting and jumping ability of an NBA star, which makes his headers a serious threat to the opposition. And he’s doing it at the same level even in his late-30s. Ronaldo, more than Messi, is the ideal model for the next generation of players.



                Ronaldo is the driving force behind his team

                Messi has an advantage over Ronaldo: Messi has won more titles mostly because he plays for a better team, not because he is a better player than Ronaldo. Throughout his entire career, Messi played for arguably the best side to ever play the game. Unlike Ronaldo’s team experiences, Messi’s Barcelona teammates know each other blindly, since most of them have played together since they were 10 years old, always the same style and formation.</p>

            <h3>Lionel Messi</h3>
            <p>Advanced statistics prove Messi is better

                Both Ronaldo and Messi have impressive stats, but a closer look at them proves Messi makes better decisions and, more importantly, brings greater value to his team. Using a framework that was originally developed for baseball, The Economist once rated Messi’s and Ronaldo’s goals based on their context and importance. Over the years, Messi has continually managed to outscore Ronaldo in the last minutes of the game, otherwise known as injury-time goals.


                Moreover, Messi makes better decisions. Using a complex algorithm, a company called GoodCall values a player’s decision-making and Efficiency Per Match (EPM). This entails valuing each pass, shot, chance created or a dribble made by players, and then rating the player’s decision-making and efficiency. Messi’s EPM and decision-making rate have been higher than Ronaldo’s, over time.



                Messi is a better team player

                Messi is not only an incredible scorer and gifted playmaker, he also makes everyone around him a better player. A true leader, he brings his team together. Not only does he have more assists and key passes than Ronaldo, he is always using his phenomenal vision to keep his teammates involved. He has great tactical intelligence, finding free spaces to move into, receiving the ball and then laying it off to a team-mate, to build attacks.



                While Ronaldo is more of an executor, who plays high up the pitch and scores great goals when given the chance, Messi, who can do that just as well, is also comfortable dropping deep and keeping possession of the ball with his team. From these positions, he can send his colleagues on dangerous runs with pin-point passes, like he did in the 2022 World Cup game against Croatia. This versatility makes him that much better than Ronaldo.
